# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Project info

I've used React 18, Typescript Redux toolkit, RTK Query (simple description of requests you can find in /modules/[module_name]/service folder).

I've used json-server for mock backend requests. If server is disable I put mock object to store

### Install

``` npm i ``` or ``` yarn ```

then 

``` npm run start ``` or ``` yarn start```

to start mock backend run:

``` cd mock-backend```

and

``` json-server --watch test.json --routes routes.json --port 3001 ```


### My Environment

nodejs v14.17.6
npm v6.14.16
tsc v4.0.3
